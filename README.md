**Bash is powerful but painful. Rad gives you Python-like scripting with CLI superpowers built-in.**

Write maintainable scripts with declarative argument parsing, built-in JSON processing, HTTP requests, and interactive
user prompts - all in a familiar, readable syntax.

## The Problem with Bash

**What you actually want:**

![vsc-example.png](./assets/vsc-example.png)

**You get this for free:**

```shell
> ./greet --help
Greets someone by name, potentially a lot of times!

Usage:
  greet <name> [times] [shout] [greeting]

Script args:
      --name str          Name of the person to greet.
      --times int         How many times to greet them. Range: (0, 10] (default 1)
  -s, --shout             Enable to shout at them!
      --greeting str      How to greet the person. Valid values: [Hi, Hello, Hey]. (default Hi)
```

```shell
> ./greet bob 3 -s
HI, BOB!
HI, BOB!
HI, BOB!
```

## Why Rad? üöÄ

- **CLI-first design** ‚Üí Args, validation, and `--help` are part of the language
- **Familiar syntax** ‚Üí Python-like, readable, no Bash footguns
- **Declarative arguments** ‚Üí Automatic `--help`, type checking, validation, and parsing
- **JSON made easy** ‚Üí Simple paths for extraction and tabular output
- **HTTP built-in** ‚Üí Query APIs, process results, and render tables in a few lines
- **Interactive prompts** ‚Üí `pick()`, `input()`, etc, for user input & selection menus
- **Shell when you want it** ‚Üí Run commands and capture output

## Real-World Example: API to Table

Fetch and display GitHub commits in one, minimal script:

```rad
#!/usr/bin/env rad
args:
    repo str        # The repo to query. Format: user/project
    limit int = 20  # Max commits to return

url = "https://api.github.com/repos/{repo}/commits?per_page={limit}"

Time = json[].commit.author.date
Author = json[].commit.author.name
SHA = json[].sha

rad url:
    fields Time, Author, SHA
```

Put this `commits` script on your PATH, and invoke:

```shell
> commits spf13/cobra 3
Querying url: https://api.github.com/repos/spf13/cobra/commits?per_page=3
Time                  Author          SHA

```

No `curl | jq | awk` gymnastics. No argparse boilerplate. Just readable code that does what you want.

Explaining the above script:

1. The script takes two args: a repo string and an optional limit (defaults to 20).
    - The `#` comments are read by Rad and used to generate helpful docs / usage strings for the script.
2. It uses string interpolation to build the url we will query, based on the supplied args.
3. It defines the fields to extract from the JSON response.
4. It executes the query, extracting the specified fields from the response, and displays the resulting data as a table.
    - Note the `rad url` syntax: "rad" actually stands for "request and display", which is what this built-in syntax
      does.

This example is kept somewhat minimal - there are Rad features we could use to further improve this.

Some alternative valid invocations for this example:

- `> commits amterp/rad`
- `> commits --repo amterp/rad --limit 5`
- `> commits --limit 5 --repo amterp/rad`
- `> commits amterp/rad --limit 5`

| HTTP requests          | curl + pipes              | Import requests               | Built-in; first-class support |
| Dependencies           | None, but limited         | Likely need libraries         | None - batteries included     |

**Python note:** Libraries like `typer` and `click` make CLI tools easier, but Rad goes further.
CLI is **designed into the language syntax itself**, allowing us to do things and achieve ergonomics
that Python libraries simply can't. Plus, no dependency management needed.

- ‚úÖ Actively maintained and improving
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking changes between versions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Rough edges and missing features

**The upside:** Your feedback directly shapes the language. Feature requests and bug reports are not just
welcomed - they're invaluable!

## Why *not* Rad? ü§î

Rad is optimized for CLI scripting, so if you find yourself building any of the following, a general-purpose language 
(Python, Go, Rust, etc) may be more appropriate:

- Enterprise applications
- High-performance computations
- Projects requiring specialized libraries

## Why I Built This

I love Bash for quick scripts. But every time I need to parse arguments properly, validate input, or work with JSON, I
end up writing the same painful boilerplate.

Python is great, but for a simple CLI tool, you shouldn't need argparse, dependencies, and subprocess.run() before you
even start solving your actual problem.

Rad is the language I wish existed when I started writing scripts. It takes the best parts of modern languages and adds
purpose-built features for CLI scripting.
