  "type": "feature",

  "description": "`streaming stdin` meaning like something you can iterate through?\n\ngenerator fn referring to those functions that `yield` a value on each call\n\nthought: I wonder if we can avoid introducing a new type entirely, and simply extend RadList and RadMap to support 'lazy eval', and simply hide the generation."
