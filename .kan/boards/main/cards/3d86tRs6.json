  "description": "confirm $!`ls`\n\nif that confirm is rejected, then the script exits.\n\nWe should allow like this:\n\nconfirm unsafe $`ls`\n\nTo then not _exit_ when rejected.\n\nIf no `unsafe`, then do usual `fail`/ `recover` blocks.\n\nBasically, `confirm` should simply mean: confirm with user prior to running command. If yes, proceed as normal. If not, simulate command failure with code 1 and exit message User rejected shell command."
