  "description": "prerequisite: RAD-116\n\nbe able to import functions defined from other scripts, for example:\n\n```\nimport * from otherscript.rsl\n```\n\n^ perhaps can elide `.rsl`?\n\n```\nimport cut, run from otherscript\n```\n\nAssess syntax, and ordering e.g. write script first then the things you import?\n\nconsider some Go-like Init mechanism? Could allow files to e.g. memoize? Files can almost become a sort of 'class'? Potentially powerful.\n\nHaving custom functions and imports would also allow for some stdlib equivalent and namespacing, i.e. defining official library functions in a stdlib"
