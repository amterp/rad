  "description": "```\nargs:\n  name string\n\n// alternatives\na = json.{name}\nb = json.\"{name}\"\nc = json[\"{name}\"]\nd = json_path([name])\n```\n\nThoughts:\n\n* A: Seems inconsistent, though arguably consistent with map.dot.syntax. Don't love it.\n* B: Seems a bit better/consistent than A, and might be consistent depending on how we implement RAD-48.\n* C: Maybe. Feels like the vegetable option. But also maybe surprising, don't love it either.\n* D: This might be pretty decent/flexible actually. The big advantage here is that it's _truly_ dynamic."
