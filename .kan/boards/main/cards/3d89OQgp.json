  "description": "The ability to invoke `rad bundle <script>` to produce a standalone executable.\n\nOptions:\n\n* Create a new Go executable with `rad` and the script embedded.\n    * Cons: leads to large ~12 MB scripts.\n    * Can perhaps look into minimizers e.g. TinyGo.\n\n* Implement my own compiler."
