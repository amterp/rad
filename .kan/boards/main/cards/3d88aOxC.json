  "description": "* each version installation installs `rad` and e.g. `rad0.6.8` ?\n* Rad knows how to find all these, can list them and manage them\n* Have a way for scripts to indicate what they're compatible with or written with in mind?\n* Maybe teach rad how to download & run target scripts with appropriate versions of rad."
