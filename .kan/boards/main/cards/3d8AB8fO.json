  "description": "`matches = [id for _, id, sym in zip(ids, symbols) if sym == \"\"]`\n\nremembering to have the `_` prefix when you're not interested in the index can be tricky, and it's easy to forget and might catch people off guard. Might need a better syntax.\n\n```\nfor id, sym in zip(...) loop:\n  loop.idx\n```\n\nfor example? or just make `loop` the index itself (name e.g. `idx` by convention)\n\nJinja2 apparently kinda does this, we should include a .last and .first bool maybe.",
