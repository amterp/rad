  "description": "Let's make RLS help with functions, as that's one of the less easy parts of writing RSL atm.\n\nIdeas:\n\n* Error on unknown function names\n* Error on invalid function usage (advanced)\n* Offer code action when a function is highlighted to open reference page for said function\n\nImplementation:\n\n* We have `funcs.go` which nicely defines things about our functions. We can probably reuse this. A separate main which calls into this symbol, and just reads function metadata? Writes out e.g. function names to a file, that we can then build RLS with.",
