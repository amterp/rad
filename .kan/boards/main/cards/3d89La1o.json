  "description": "`x ? y : z` ternaries are a little out of fashion and admittedly don't read super naturally.\n\nPython does `y if x else z`. Other languages do `if x { y } else { z }`. The latter is ideal, if your language uses braces, but since Python (and Rad) do not, the former is more realistic. I don't like the flipped ordering of the former though (weird ordering imo).\n\nMaybe a `if x then y else z` syntax would work? Though means introducing a new keyword `then` and pulls the syntax a little further from existing if-else statements."
