# Principles

## RSL

- RSL has a specific use case. Tailor to that.
- Unless there's clear value in diverging from other programming language norms, then stick with what's familiar.
- Err on the side of readability/verbosity. No cryptic symbols; RSL should be self-explanatory and comprehensible to people who've never seen it before.
