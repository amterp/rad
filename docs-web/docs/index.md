!!! warning "These docs are still a work in progress!"

    These docs are actively being worked on, and there are critical sections missing.

    Rad is also evolving, and so some docs here may be out of date. If you have any questions at all, don't hesitate to ask on [Discussions](https://github.com/amterp/rad/discussions)!

    The [Guide](./guide/getting-started.md) is pretty substantial and gives you quite a lot to go on, feel free to check it out!
