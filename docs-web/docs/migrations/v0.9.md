# Migrating to Rad v0.9

Version 0.9 renames `get_stash_dir` to `get_stash_path`. This guide will help you update your scripts.

## Breaking Change: `get_stash_dir` Renamed

### What Changed

`get_stash_dir` was renamed to `get_stash_path` to better reflect its behavior - it returns a *path* (often to a file), not necessarily a directory.

### Old Syntax (No Longer Works)

```rad
path = get_stash_dir()
path = get_stash_dir("data/config.json")
```

### New Syntax

```rad
path = get_stash_path()
path = get_stash_path("data/config.json")
```

## Migration Steps

1. **Find all uses of `get_stash_dir`** in your scripts
2. **Replace with `get_stash_path`** - the signature and behavior are identical

## New: `catch` Operator

The `catch` operator provides inline error catching as an expression. It catches errors but lets null values pass through.

```rad
count = parse_int(input_str) catch 0
data = parse_json(raw) catch {}
```

This is distinct from the `catch:` block syntax. The operator form is an inline expression; `catch:` is a block attached to statements.

## Error Messages

If you run a script that still uses `get_stash_dir`, you'll see a helpful error:

```
error: Cannot invoke unknown function: get_stash_dir

  hint: get_stash_dir was renamed to get_stash_path.
