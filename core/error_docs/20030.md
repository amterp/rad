# RAD20030: Break Outside Loop

A `break` statement was used outside of a loop (`for` or `while`).

The `break` statement is only valid inside loops - it tells the loop to stop
iterating and continue with the code after the loop.

## Example

```rad
# Wrong: break outside any loop
x = 10
if x > 5:
    break  # Error: break outside loop
```

```rad
# Correct: break inside a loop
for i in range(10):
    if i > 5:
        break  # Exits the for loop
    print(i)
```

## How to Fix

1. **Use `exit()` to stop the script** if you want to end execution early:
   ```rad
   if error_condition:
       exit(1)
   ```

2. **Use `return` to exit a function**:
   ```rad
   fn process():
       if bad_input:
           return  # Exits the function, not a loop
   ```

3. **Restructure your code** - If you need early exit logic, consider whether
   the code should be inside a loop or use different control flow.
