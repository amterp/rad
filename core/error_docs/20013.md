# RAD20013: File Walk Error

An error occurred while traversing a directory with `find_paths()`.

## Common Causes

- **Permission denied** - can't access a subdirectory
- **Symlink loops** - circular symbolic links
- **Directory removed** - directory deleted during traversal

## How to Fix

```rad
files = find_paths(dir) catch:
    print_err("Failed to scan directory: {files}")
    exit(1)
```

Check that you have read access to all directories in the tree.
