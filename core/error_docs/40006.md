# RAD40006: Invalid Assignment Target

The left side of an assignment isn't something that can be assigned to.

## Example

```rad
# Wrong
5 = x
a + b = 10

# Valid assignment targets
x = 5              # Variable
items[0] = 10      # List element
data["key"] = "v"  # Map entry
a, b = [1, 2]      # Unpacking
x += 1             # Compound
```

The left side of `=` must be a variable, index expression, or unpacking pattern.
