# RAD40001: Scientific Notation Not a Whole Number

Scientific notation was used where an integer is required, but the result has
a fractional part.

## Example

```rad
args:
    count int = 1.5e1  # Error: 15.0 is not a whole number

# Works: these produce whole numbers
args:
    count int = 1e3    # 1000
    batch int = 2e2    # 200
```

## What This Means

Scientific notation like `1e3` means 1 x 10^3 = 1000. When used where an integer
is expected, the result must be a whole number. `1.5e1` produces 15.0, which
has an implicit decimal part.

Use plain integers (`1000`) or ensure the notation produces an exact integer.
