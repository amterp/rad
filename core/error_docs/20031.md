# RAD20031: Continue Outside Loop

A `continue` statement was used outside of a loop (`for` or `while`).

The `continue` statement is only valid inside loops - it tells the loop to skip
the rest of the current iteration and move to the next one.

## Example

```rad
# Wrong: continue outside any loop
x = 10
if x < 20:
    continue  # Error: continue outside loop
```

```rad
# Correct: continue inside a loop
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue  # Skip even numbers
    print(i)  # Only prints odd numbers
```

## How to Fix

1. **Restructure conditional logic** - Use `if/else` instead:
   ```rad
   for item in items:
       if condition:
           process(item)
       # No else needed - just don't do anything
   ```

2. **Check your nesting** - Make sure `continue` is inside the loop body,
   not in a function defined inside the loop.
