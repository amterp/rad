# RAD20014: Mutually Exclusive Arguments

Two command-line arguments that can't be used together were both specified.

## Example

```rad
args:
    verbose bool
    quiet bool
    $excl quiet verbose  # Can't use both
```

Running with `--verbose --quiet` triggers this error.

## How to Fix

Use only one of the conflicting options. Run `--help` to see which arguments are mutually exclusive.
