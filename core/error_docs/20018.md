# RAD20018: Empty List

An operation that requires at least one element was called on an empty list.

## Example

```rad
items = []
first = items[0]       # No first element
max_val = max(items)   # Nothing to compare
```

## How to Fix

Check the list length first:

```rad
if len(items) > 0:
    first = items[0]
else:
    first = "default"
```

Or use a conditional expression:

```rad
first = items[0] if len(items) > 0 else "default"
```
