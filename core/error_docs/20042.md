# RAD20042: Internal Bug

This is a bug in Rad, not your script. Something went wrong inside the interpreter.

## What to Do

Please report this at https://github.com/amterp/rad/issues with:
- The error message and stack trace
- Your script (or a minimal version that reproduces it)
- Your Rad version (`rad --version`)
- Your OS

As a workaround, try restructuring the problematic code - sometimes a different approach avoids the bug.
