# RAD20042: Internal Bug

This error indicates a bug in Rad itself, not in your script. Something unexpected
happened that the Rad interpreter didn't handle correctly.

## What This Means

Your script may be perfectly valid, but Rad encountered an internal error while
trying to run it. This is not your fault.

## What to Do

1. **Report the bug** - Please file an issue at:
   https://github.com/amterp/rad/issues

2. **Include in your report:**
   - The error message and stack trace
   - Your Rad script (or a minimal version that reproduces the issue)
   - Your Rad version (`rad --version`)
   - Your operating system

3. **Workaround** - Try simplifying or restructuring the problematic code.
   Sometimes a different approach avoids the bug.

## Thank You

Bug reports help make Rad better for everyone. We appreciate you taking the time
to report issues you encounter.
