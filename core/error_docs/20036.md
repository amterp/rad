# RAD20036: Division by Zero

An attempt was made to divide or modulo by zero. This is mathematically undefined.

## Examples

```rad
x = 10 / 0   # Error: division by zero
y = 10 % 0   # Error: modulo by zero
```

```rad
divisor = 0
result = 100 / divisor  # Error: division by zero
```

## How to Fix

1. **Check for zero before dividing**:
   ```rad
   if divisor != 0:
       result = value / divisor
   else:
       result = 0  # or handle the error case appropriately
   ```

2. **Validate input data** - If the divisor comes from user input or external
   data, validate it before using.

3. **Use a default value**:
   ```rad
   divisor = input_value if input_value != 0 else 1
   ```
