# RAD20005: File Does Not Exist

The file or directory wasn't found at the specified path.

## Example

```rad
content = read_file("missing.txt")  # File doesn't exist
```

## How to Fix

Check file existence first:

```rad
info = get_path(filepath)
if info.exists:
    content = read_file(filepath)
else:
    print("File not found: {filepath}")
```

Or handle the error:

```rad
content = read_file(filepath) catch:
    print_err("Could not read: {content}")
    exit(1)
```

Common issues: typos in the path, relative paths resolving to the wrong location, or case sensitivity on some filesystems.
