# RAD20006: File Write Error

Rad couldn't write to the file.

## Common Causes

- **Permission denied** - no write access to file or directory
- **Disk full** - no space left on device
- **Directory doesn't exist** - parent directory is missing

## How to Fix

```rad
write_file(filepath, content) catch:
    print_err("Failed to write: {filepath}")
    exit(1)
```

Check that:
1. You have write access to the directory
2. The parent directory exists
3. There's enough disk space
