# RAD10017: Missing Newline

The parser expected a newline but found more code on the same line.

## Example

```rad
# Wrong
if true: print("hello")

# Correct
if true:
    print("hello")
```

Each statement needs its own line. After block headers like `if:`, `for:`, or `fn:`,
the body must start on a new indented line.
