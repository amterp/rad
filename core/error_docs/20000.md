# RAD20000: Generic Runtime Error

This is a catch-all for runtime errors that don't have a more specific error code. The error message itself describes what went wrong.

Read the error message carefully. If this error seems like it should have its own code, consider filing an issue at https://github.com/amterp/rad/issues
