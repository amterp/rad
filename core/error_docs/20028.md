# RAD20028: Undefined Variable

You're using a variable that hasn't been defined yet.

## Example

```rad
username = "alice"
print(usernme)  # Error: typo - 'usernme' doesn't exist
```

## Common Causes

- **Typos** - Check the spelling. Rad suggests similar names if it finds any.
- **Wrong order** - The variable must be assigned before you use it.
- **Scope** - Variables inside functions aren't visible outside:

```rad
fn setup():
    config = "value"  # only exists inside setup()

setup()
print(config)  # Error: config is not defined here
```

## Note

Rad is case-sensitive: `MyVar` and `myvar` are different variables.
