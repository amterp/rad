# RAD20028: Undefined Variable

A variable was used before it was defined. Rad requires variables to be assigned
a value before they can be read.

## Common Causes

1. **Typos in variable names** - `username` vs `usernme`
2. **Using a variable before assignment** - Reading before the assignment line
3. **Scope issues** - Variable defined in a different scope (inside a function or block)
4. **Case sensitivity** - `MyVar` and `myvar` are different variables

## Example

```rad
# Wrong: using 'usernme' instead of 'username'
username = "alice"
print(usernme)  # Error: Undefined variable: usernme
```

## How to Fix

1. **Check the spelling** - Look for typos. Rad will suggest similar variable names
   if it finds any.

2. **Check the order** - Make sure the variable is assigned before you use it:
   ```rad
   # Wrong order:
   print(x)
   x = 10

   # Correct:
   x = 10
   print(x)
   ```

3. **Check the scope** - Variables defined inside functions aren't visible outside:
   ```rad
   fn setup():
       config = "value"  # Only exists inside setup()

   setup()
   print(config)  # Error: config is not defined here
   ```

If you see "a variable with a similar name exists", double-check your spelling.
Rad uses Levenshtein distance to suggest variables that are close to what you typed.
