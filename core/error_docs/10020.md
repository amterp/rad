# RAD10020: Unterminated String

A string literal is missing its closing quote.

## Example

```rad
# Wrong
message = "Hello, world

# Correct
message = "Hello, world"
```

Rad supports double quotes (`"`), single quotes (`'`), and backticks (`` ` ``).
Each string must close with the same quote type it opened with.
