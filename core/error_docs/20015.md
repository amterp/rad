# RAD20015: Zip Strict Length Mismatch

`zip()` was called with `strict=true` on lists of different lengths.

## Example

```rad
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = ["a", "b"]

pairs = zip(a, b, strict=true)  # Error: lengths 3 vs 2
```

## How to Fix

Either make the lists the same length, or use non-strict mode (which truncates to the shortest):

```rad
pairs = zip(a, b)  # Stops at shortest list: [[1, "a"], [2, "b"]]
```
