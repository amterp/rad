# RAD10019: Unexpected Indent

Indentation appeared where none was expected, or indentation is inconsistent.

## Example

```rad
# Wrong: indented top-level code
    x = 5

# Correct
x = 5
```

```rad
# Wrong: inconsistent indentation
if true:
    print("one")
      print("two")

# Correct
if true:
    print("one")
    print("two")
```

Use consistent indentation within each block and don't indent top-level code.
