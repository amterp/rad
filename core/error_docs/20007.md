# RAD20007: Ambiguous Epoch

The timestamp value is ambiguous - Rad can't tell if it's seconds or milliseconds since epoch.

## What This Means

Unix timestamps come in two common formats:
- **Seconds** (10 digits): `1700000000`
- **Milliseconds** (13 digits): `1700000000000`

Some values fall in an ambiguous range where they could reasonably be either.

## How to Fix

Use a timestamp with a clear magnitude, or use explicit parsing that specifies the unit. Timestamps around 10 digits are typically seconds; around 13 digits are typically milliseconds.
