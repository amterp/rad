# RAD40005: Yield Outside Function

A `yield` statement appeared outside of a function body.

## Example

```rad
# Wrong
yield 5  # Error: not inside a function

# Correct: yield inside a generator function
fn numbers():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

for n in numbers():
    print(n)
```

`yield` creates generator functions that produce values one at a time. Each
`yield` pauses the function until the next value is requested. It only makes
sense inside a function definition.
