# RAD10022: Keyword Misuse

A keyword was used in a context where it doesn't belong.

## Example

```rad
# Wrong
else:
    print("error")

# Correct
if condition:
    print("if branch")
else:
    print("else branch")
```

Keywords like `else` and `elif` must follow an `if`, `case` and `default` must be
inside a `switch`, and `break` and `continue` must be inside a loop.
