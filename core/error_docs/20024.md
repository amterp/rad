# RAD20024: Invalid Regular Expression

The regex pattern has a syntax error.

## Example

```rad
# Wrong: unclosed bracket
matches("hello", "[invalid")

# Correct
matches("hello", "[a-z]+")
matches("test123", "\\d+")
```

## Common Mistakes

- Unclosed `[` or `(`
- Quantifiers (`*`, `+`, `?`) with nothing before them: `"*abc"` should be `".*abc"`
- Missing escape: use `\\d` for digits, `\\.` for literal dot

Rad uses Go's regex syntax. Test complex patterns with an online regex tester.
