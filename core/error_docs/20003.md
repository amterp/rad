# RAD20003: File Read Error

Rad couldn't read a file from the filesystem.

## Common Causes

1. **File doesn't exist** - The path points to a file that isn't there
2. **Permission denied** - You don't have read access to the file
3. **Path is a directory** - You tried to read a directory as a file
4. **Invalid path** - The path contains invalid characters or syntax

## Examples

```rad
content = read_file("/path/to/missing.txt")
# Error if the file doesn't exist
```

## How to Fix

1. **Check if the file exists first**:
   ```rad
   info = get_path("/path/to/file.txt")
   if info.exists:
       content = read_file("/path/to/file.txt")
   ```

2. **Use absolute paths** - Relative paths are relative to the current working
   directory, which might not be what you expect.

3. **Check permissions** - Ensure you have read access to the file:
   ```bash
   ls -la /path/to/file.txt
   ```

4. **Handle errors explicitly**:
   ```rad
   result = read_file(path)
   if type_of(result) == "error":
       print_err("Could not read file: {result}")
       exit(1)
   ```

## Note

Use `get_path()` to check file properties before reading. It returns information
about whether the file exists, its permissions, size, and more.
