# RAD20003: File Read Error

Rad couldn't read the file.

## Common Causes

- **File doesn't exist** - check the path
- **Permission denied** - you don't have read access
- **Path is a directory** - you tried to read a directory as a file

## Example

```rad
content = read_file("/path/to/file.txt") catch:
    print_err("Could not read file: {content}")
    exit(1)
```

## How to Fix

Check if the file exists before reading:

```rad
info = get_path("/path/to/file.txt")
if info.exists:
    content = read_file("/path/to/file.txt")
```

Or handle the error with a fallback:

```rad
content = read_file(path) ?? ""
```
