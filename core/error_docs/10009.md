# RAD10009: Unexpected Token

The parser found a token that doesn't make sense in the current context.

## Example

```rad
# Wrong
x = + 5

# Correct
x = 5
```

The caret (`^`) in the error message points to the unexpected token. Look for
extra symbols, misplaced keywords, or copy-paste errors around that location.
