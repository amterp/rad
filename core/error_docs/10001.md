# RAD10001: Invalid Syntax

This is a catch-all for syntax that doesn't match any expected pattern. The error
message describes the specific problem.

## Example

```rad
# Wrong
x + 1 = y

# Correct
y = x + 1
```

## How to Fix

The caret (`^`) in the error message points to where the parser got confused. Check
for typos, missing punctuation, or mismatched brackets around that location.

If you think this error should have a more specific code, consider filing an issue.
