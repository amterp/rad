# RAD10001: Invalid Syntax

The parser encountered something it couldn't understand. This is a catch-all error
for syntax that doesn't match any expected pattern.

## Common Causes

1. **Typos in keywords** - Using `fnc` instead of `fn`, `wihle` instead of `while`, etc.
2. **Missing operators** - Forgetting `=` in assignments or `:` in blocks
3. **Mismatched brackets** - Unclosed `(`, `[`, or `{`
4. **Invalid characters** - Using characters that aren't valid in Rad

## Examples

```rad
# Missing colon after if condition
if true
    print("hello")

# Should be:
if true:
    print("hello")
```

```rad
# Invalid assignment syntax
x + 1 = y

# Should be:
y = x + 1
```

## How to Fix

Look at the error location and check:
- Is the syntax spelled correctly?
- Are all brackets balanced?
- Is punctuation (`:`, `=`, `,`) in the right places?

The caret (`^`) in the error message points to where the parser got confused.
