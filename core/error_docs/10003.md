# RAD10003: Missing Identifier

The parser expected a name (variable, function, or argument) but didn't find one.

## Example

```rad
# Wrong
for in [1, 2, 3]:
    print("hi")

# Correct
for i in [1, 2, 3]:
    print(i)
```

Identifiers must start with a letter or underscore, and contain only letters,
numbers, and underscores.
