# RAD30007: Wrong Argument Count

A function was called with too few or too many arguments.

## Example

```rad
fn add(a, b):
    return a + b

add(5)        # Error: missing argument 'b'
add(1, 2, 3)  # Error: too many arguments
```

## How to Fix

Check the function signature. Use `rad docs functions <name>` to see the
expected arguments for built-in functions.

```rad
add(5, 10)  # Correct: two arguments
```

Named arguments can help clarify which is which:
```rad
process(input=value, output=dest)
```
