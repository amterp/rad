# RAD20026: Stdin Read Error

Something went wrong while reading from standard input - the stream may have been closed or corrupted.

## How to Fix

Check whether stdin is available before reading:

```rad
if has_stdin():
    data = read_stdin()
else:
    print_err("No input provided")
    exit(1)
```
