# RAD20023: Invalid Sleep Duration

The `sleep()` function received a duration it doesn't understand.

## Example

```rad
# Wrong
sleep("abc")      # not a valid duration
sleep("5x")       # unknown unit

# Correct
sleep(1.5)        # 1.5 seconds (numbers are seconds)
sleep("500ms")    # 500 milliseconds
sleep("2s")       # 2 seconds
sleep("1m")       # 1 minute
sleep("1h")       # 1 hour
```

## Valid Units

| Unit | Meaning      |
|------|--------------|
| ms   | milliseconds |
| s    | seconds      |
| m    | minutes      |
| h    | hours        |

Numbers without units are treated as seconds.
