# RAD20035: Switch Multiple Match

The value matched more than one case, and Rad doesn't know which to use.

## Example

```rad
value = 5

switch value:
    case x if x > 0:
        print("Positive")
    case x if x < 10:
        print("Less than 10")
# Error: 5 matches both conditions
```

## How to Fix

Make your cases mutually exclusive:

```rad
switch value:
    case x if x >= 10:
        print("10 or more")
    case x if x > 0:
        print("Positive but less than 10")
    default:
        print("Zero or negative")
```
