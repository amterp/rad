# RAD20016: Cast Failed

A type cast with `as` failed because the value couldn't be converted.

## Example

```rad
x = "hello" as int  # Can't cast non-numeric string to int
```

## How to Fix

Use conversion functions instead of casting - they provide better error handling:

```rad
x = parse_int("42") ?? 0
y = parse_float("3.14") ?? 0.0
s = str(value)
```

These functions can be used with `catch:` or `??` for proper error handling.
