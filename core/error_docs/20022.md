# RAD20022: Stash ID Not Found

The stash ID you're trying to load doesn't exist.

Stashes let scripts persist data between runs. You need to `stash_save()` before you can `stash_load()`.

## Example

```rad
# Wrong: stash doesn't exist yet
data = stash_load("my-config")

# Correct: save first, then load later
stash_save("my-config", {"theme": "dark"})
# ... in a later run:
data = stash_load("my-config")
```

## How to Fix

Handle missing stashes with a fallback:

```rad
data = stash_load("my-config") catch:
    data = {"theme": "light"}  # default
```

To see existing stashes, run `rad stash list`.
