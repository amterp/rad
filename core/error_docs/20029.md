# RAD20029: Index Out of Bounds

An attempt was made to access an element at an index that doesn't exist in the
list or string.

## Common Causes

1. **Off-by-one errors** - Lists are 0-indexed, so a list of length 3 has valid indices 0, 1, 2
2. **Empty lists** - Trying to access any index on an empty list
3. **Dynamic indices** - Using a variable index without checking bounds first

## Examples

```rad
items = ["a", "b", "c"]  # Indices 0, 1, 2
print(items[3])  # Error: index 3 is out of bounds (length is 3)
```

```rad
items = []
print(items[0])  # Error: can't access index 0 on empty list
```

## How to Fix

1. **Check the length first**:
   ```rad
   if len(items) > index:
       print(items[index])
   ```

2. **Use get_default for maps** (returns default if key missing):
   ```rad
   value = get_default(my_map, "key", "default_value")
   ```

3. **Use negative indexing safely**:
   ```rad
   # -1 is the last element, -2 is second-to-last, etc.
   items = ["a", "b", "c"]
   print(items[-1])  # "c" - the last element
   ```

## Note

Negative indices are valid: `-1` is the last element, `-2` is second-to-last.
But if the negative index goes beyond the list start, you'll still get this error.
