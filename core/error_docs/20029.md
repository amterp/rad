# RAD20029: Index Out of Bounds

You tried to access an index that doesn't exist in the list or string.

## Example

```rad
items = ["a", "b", "c"]  # valid indices: 0, 1, 2
print(items[3])  # Error: index 3 out of bounds
```

Lists are 0-indexed, so a list with 3 elements has indices 0, 1, and 2.

## How to Fix

Check the length before accessing:

```rad
if len(items) > index:
    print(items[index])
```

Negative indices work too: `-1` is the last element, `-2` is second-to-last. But going past the start (e.g., `items[-10]` on a 3-element list) still causes this error.
