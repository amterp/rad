# RAD20017: Number Out of Range

A numeric value is outside the valid range for the operation.

## Example

```rad
# Integer overflow
big = 99999999999999999999999
x = int(big)  # Exceeds int64 range
```

## How to Fix

Check that values are within acceptable bounds before the operation. For integers, the valid range is roughly -9 quintillion to +9 quintillion (int64 limits).
