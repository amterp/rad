# RAD20040: Assertion Failed

An `assert()` condition was false.

## Example

```rad
x = 5
assert(x > 10, "x must be greater than 10")  # Fails
```

## What This Means

A failed assertion means your code reached a state it shouldn't have. It's a bug, not a user error.

## When to Use Assert

Assertions catch programmer mistakes, not bad user input:

```rad
# Good: should never happen if logic is correct
assert(len(items) > 0, "items should never be empty here")

# Bad: use if/else for user input validation instead
assert(user_input != "")
```

If the condition *can* legitimately be false, use `if` instead.
