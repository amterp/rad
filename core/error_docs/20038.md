# RAD20038: Void Value

You tried to use the result of a function that doesn't return anything.

## Example

```rad
fn greet():
    print("Hello!")
    # no return statement

result = greet()  # Error: greet() returns void
```

## How to Fix

Either add a return value to the function:

```rad
fn greet():
    print("Hello!")
    return true
```

Or don't try to capture the result:

```rad
greet()  # just call it
```
