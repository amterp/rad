# RAD20012: Internal Type Check Bug

This is a bug in Rad itself, not your script.

## What to Do

Please report this at https://github.com/amterp/rad/issues with:

- The error message
- Your script (or a minimal version that reproduces it)
- Your Rad version (`rad --version`)
- Your operating system
