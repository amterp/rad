# RAD40003: Unknown Function

A function was called that hasn't been defined.

## Example

```rad
greet("Alice")  # Error: 'greet' is not defined

# Fix: define the function first
fn greet(name):
    print("Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
```

## How to Fix

1. **Check spelling** - Rad suggests similar names if any exist
2. **Define the function** - Add the function definition before the call
3. **Check scope** - Ensure the function is visible where you're calling it

Built-in functions like `print`, `len`, and `int` are always available.
