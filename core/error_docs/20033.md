# RAD20033: Unpack Mismatch

The number of variables doesn't match the number of values being unpacked.

## Example

```rad
# Wrong: 3 values, 2 variables
a, b = [1, 2, 3]

# Correct
a, b, c = [1, 2, 3]
```

## How to Fix

Either adjust the variable count, or use indexing if you only need some values:

```rad
items = [1, 2, 3]
first = items[0]
last = items[-1]
```
