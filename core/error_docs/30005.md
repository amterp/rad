# RAD30005: Cannot Assign

Assignment was attempted to something that can't be assigned to.

## Example

```rad
# Wrong
5 = x
get_value() = 5

# Right: assign to variables or index expressions
x = 5
items[0] = 10
data["key"] = "value"
a, b = [1, 2]
```

The left side of `=` must be a variable, index expression, or unpacking pattern.
