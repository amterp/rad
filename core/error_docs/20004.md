# RAD20004: File Permission Denied

You don't have permission to access this file or directory.

## Example

```rad
# Reading a protected file
content = read_file("/etc/shadow")

# Writing to a protected location
write_file("/usr/bin/myfile", "content")
```

## How to Fix

1. **Check permissions** - use `ls -la` to see file permissions
2. **Use a different location** - write to a directory you control
3. **Handle the error**:

```rad
content = read_file(path) catch:
    print_err("Cannot read file: {content}")
    exit(1)
```
