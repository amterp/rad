# RAD20032: Not Iterable

You tried to use `for` on something that can't be iterated.

## Example

```rad
# Wrong: can't iterate over an int
for x in 42:
    print(x)

# Correct: iterate over a list, string, map, or range
for x in [1, 2, 3]:
    print(x)
```

## Iterable Types

| Type   | Iterates over |
|--------|---------------|
| List   | elements      |
| String | characters    |
| Map    | keys          |
| Range  | numbers       |

Integers, floats, and booleans are not iterable.
