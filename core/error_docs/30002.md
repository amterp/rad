# RAD30002: Invalid Type for Operation

An operator was used with types that don't support that operation.

## Example

```rad
# Wrong: can't add int to string
x = "count: " + 5

# Correct: use interpolation (preferred)
x = "count: {5}"

# Correct: explicit conversion
x = "count: " + str(5)
```

## Supported Type Combinations

| Operator | Works with |
|----------|------------|
| `+` | int+int, float+float, str+str, str+error, error+str, error+error, list+list |
| `-`, `*`, `/` | int, float |
| `%` | int |
| `==`, `!=` | any types |
| `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` | int, float, str |
| `and`, `or` | any (uses truthiness) |

## How to Fix

Use interpolation to mix types in strings - it handles any type automatically:
`"Value: {x}"`. Alternatively, convert types explicitly with `int()`, `float()`, or `str()`.
