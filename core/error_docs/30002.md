# RAD30002: Invalid Type for Operation

An operator was used with types that don't support that operation.

## Example

```rad
# Wrong: can't add int to string
x = 5 + "hello"

# Correct: convert or use interpolation
x = "count: {5}"         # Interpolation handles any type
x = str(5) + "hello"     # Explicit conversion
```

## Supported Type Combinations

| Operator | Works with |
|----------|------------|
| `+` | int+int, float+float, str+str, list+list |
| `-`, `*`, `/` | int, float |
| `%` | int |
| `==`, `!=` | any types |
| `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` | int, float, str |
| `and`, `or` | any (uses truthiness) |

## How to Fix

Convert types with `int()`, `float()`, or `str()`. For mixed types in strings,
use interpolation: `"Value: {x}"` works with any type.
