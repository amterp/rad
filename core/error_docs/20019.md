# RAD20019: Argument Constraint Violated

A command-line argument didn't meet its declared constraint.

## Example

```rad
args:
    level str
    $enum level low medium high
```

Running with `--level ultra` fails because "ultra" isn't in the allowed values.

## Constraint Types

- **Enum** - value must be one of the specified options
- **Regex** - value must match a pattern
- **Range** - numeric value must be within bounds

## How to Fix

Run `--help` to see valid values. Constraints are case-sensitive.
